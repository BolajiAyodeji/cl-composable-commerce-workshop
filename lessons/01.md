# Introducing Demo Stores

The [Demo Store](https://github.com/commercelayer/demo-store) includes all of the major benefits of building a store with Commerce Layer: itâ€™s natively multi-market, it can work with any other API and it leverages some in-built microfrontends.

The demo store is full-featured and fully operational, and you can easily tailor your own with different levels of customization. You can learn more in [this announcement](https://commercelayer.io/blog/introducing-the-demo-store) on Commerce Layer's blog.
