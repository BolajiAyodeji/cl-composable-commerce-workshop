# Introducing Demo Stores

The [Demo Store](https://github.com/commercelayer/demo-store) includes all of the major benefits of building a store with Commerce Layer: itâ€™s natively multi-market, it can work with any other API and it leverages some in-built microfrontends.

The demo store is full-featured and fully operational, and you can easily tailor your own with different levels of customization. You can learn more in [this announcement](https://commercelayer.io/blog/introducing-the-demo-store) on Commerce Layer's blog.

The Demo Store comes with:

[x] Ecommerce content storage and management in JSON files.
[x] Full product catalog management with taxonomies and taxons
 single product variants management.
[x] Built-in search engine with facet search.
[x] Multi-language capabilities to make selling internationally easier.
[x] Extensive set of features provided out of the box by Commerce Layer APIs (multiple currency price lists, inventory models that support multiple stock locations and fulfillment strategies, market-specific payment gateways, delivery options and carrier accounts, etc.)
