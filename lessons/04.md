# Deploying the Ecommerce Solution

There are two things you need to do before you deploy your store using your favorite hosting platforms (e.g, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudfare Pages, etc.):

1. Set all the environment variables in the deployment service you'll use to run the build.

2. Decide if you want to go with static site generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR).

## SSG

1. Add this in addition to other variables in your env:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_FETCHING=ssg
```

2. Run `npm run export` to create a static optimized production build of your application.

3. Copy the folder in `demo-store-core/packages/website/out` to your preferred static hosting.

## SSR

1. Add this in addition to other variables in your env:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_FETCHING=ssr
```

2. Set the output directory to `demo-store-core/packages/website/out`.

3. Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build of your application.
